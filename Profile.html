    <h2>The Jonas Brothers</h2>

    <p>The Jonas Brothers are an American pop rock band. Formed in 2005, they gained popularity from their appearances on the Disney Channel television network. They consist of three brothers: Kevin Jonas, Joe Jonas, and Nick Jonas.Raised in Wyckoff, New Jersey, the Jonas Brothers moved to Little Falls, New Jersey, in 2005, where they wrote their first record that made its Hollywood Records release. They starred in the 2008 Disney Channel Original Movie Camp Rock and its 2010 sequel, Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam. They also starred in their own Disney Channel series Jonas, which was rebranded as Jonas L.A. for its second season. The band have released five albums: It's About Time (2006), Jonas Brothers (2007), A Little Bit Longer (2008), Lines, Vines and Trying Times (2009), and Happiness Begins (2019).

      In 2008, the group was nominated for the Best New Artist award at the 51st Grammy Awards and won the award for Breakthrough Artist at the American Music Awards. Before the release of Lines, Vines and Trying Times, they had sold over eight million albums worldwide. After a hiatus between 2010 and 2011 to pursue solo projects, the group reunited in 2012 to record a new album, which was cancelled following their break-up on October 29, 2013.
      
      They have sold over 17 million albums worldwide as of 2013. Six years following their split, the group reunited with the release of "Sucker" on March 1, 2019. The song became the 34th song in history to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and became the Jonas Brothers' first number one single on the chart. Their fifth studio album, Happiness Begins, was released on June 7, 2019, topped the US Billboard 200.</p>

              <p>Born on November 5, 1987 in New Jersey, kevin Jonas has 3 brothers Nicholas Jerry Jonas, Joseph Adam Jonas, and Franklin Nathaniel Jonas. He got his start doing commercials. Later he and his brothers wrote a song called please be mine and that is when they realized that that could be something. They formed their band in 2005. They came up with the name J3 but changed it right before their first show. They kept writing songs until 2013 when their band broke up. While Nick and Joe kept making music just on their own/with another group, Kevin decided to start a family with his wife Danielle. They got married back in Dec. 2009 and decided it was time to have kids. Their first daughter Alena Rose Jonas was born on Feb. 2,2014 and their second daughter Valentina Angelina Jonas on Oct. 27,2016. They raised them and had fun. Then the Jonas Brothers decided to reunite as a band while shooting their documentary Chasing Happiness. They went on tour in 2019 and Kevin's family came too. During 2020 Kevin has stayed home with his family but done zoom calls and video recorded singing and playing guitar so we can keep up with him and his brothers during the pandemic.</p>
