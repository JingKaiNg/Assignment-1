# Project's Name

I am creating a website for one of my favourite and most underrated band. I have been a fan of Jonas Brothers ever since they got together in 2005. However, not many of my friends knows about them, their career and their music. Hence, I wanted to create a website for them so as to introduce this band to more people. 

# Design Process
My target audience of this website would be to the upcoming generation of students. As Jonas Brothers is a really old band, they are not every popular and known by the younger generation of people. 

I hope that this website would be able to introduce and show the wonderful and nice music produced by the Jonas Brothers to the younger generation. I hope that that the younger generation can start listening to this band and learn to appreciate their different type of music. I also hope that the Jonas Brothers will be able to get more recognition and love from the younger generation. 

I feel that my project is the best way to help this band achieve more recognition and attention from the younger generation as my website not only contain a profile of each band member (so that the audience can know and connect with them better), but also some of the Jonas Brothers’ top songs and albums. In this way, it is more convenient for the target audience to be able to find the band’s most popular songs and listen to them. 

# User Stories
•	As a secondary 2 student, I want to perform an action so that when I click on the band member’s profile, it can allow me to be able to view their background and what they are known for easily.
•	As a primary school student, I would like to be able to access the band’s merch with just a simple click of a button.
